# Apartment Web Scrape
This Jupyter Notebook project gathers a huge amount of information from apartments around a specified area (personally using Dayton area) by using Python's BeautifulSoup library.
My Python script gave me a good overview of how my data should be written into a file, and finally into a csv table.
After executing my notebook code, I rearranged the data table and fine tuned the content of the cells in order to make it possible and more convenient to use the data for further analysis.

I used this project in the past to find my current apartment I am living in. The script gave me all information I needed to decide which apartment in the South Oklahoma City would most likely match my needs and financial limits.


Worked on it all by  myself starting from scratch

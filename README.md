# webScrape
In this project, I am trying to gather a huge amount of information from apartments around the Dayton Area by using Python in relation to web scraping.
Afterwards, I will use data analysis tools with python to examine my data!
joooooo ooooooof!
Maybe end up using machine learning tools as well.

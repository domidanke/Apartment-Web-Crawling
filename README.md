# webScrape
In this project, I am trying to gather a huge amount of information from apartments around the Dayton Area by using Python in relation to web scraping.
My Python script gave me a good overview of how my data should be written into a file, and finally into a csv table.
After executing my notebook code, I rearranged the data table and fine tuned the content of the cells in order to make it possible and more convenient to use the data for further analysis.



Worked on it all by  myself AND started FROM SCRATCH
